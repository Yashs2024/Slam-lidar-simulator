## 🗺️ What Is This?

SLAM (**Simultaneous Localization and Mapping**) is one of the most important concepts in modern robotics. This project lets students *see* every step of the process in real time — no PhD required.

A differential-drive robot equipped with a 2D LiDAR sensor explores a 2D arena. As it drives, it builds an **occupancy grid map** of its environment from scratch — just using the noisy distance measurements from its rotating laser. You can set goals, watch it navigate autonomously with **A\* pathfinding**, draw your own obstacles, and see everything reflected in live charts and a fog-of-war map.

## 🔬 Algorithm Deep Dives

### LiDAR Raycasting
Each ray is cast from the robot's position at a given angle. The simulator checks it for intersection against every wall segment using standard computational geometry (parametric line-line intersection with `t` and `u` coefficients). The closest intersection becomes the sensor reading. Gaussian-like noise is then added.

### Occupancy Grid SLAM
The map is a 2D grid of cells. After each scan, cells along the ray path are marked **free** (known empty), and the cell at the hit point is marked **occupied** (wall detected). This is a simplified Bresenham-line voting scheme — the precursor to probabilistic methods like **Bayesian SLAM** and **Particle Filters**.

### A\* Pathfinding
The A\* implementation uses `Uint8Array` and `Float32Array` typed arrays for the open/closed sets, eliminating JavaScript string key allocations entirely. This keeps search times under **1ms** even on large maps.

### Fog of War (Canvas Compositing)
An off-screen `<canvas>` is filled entirely opaque (the "fog"). Each frame, the LiDAR hit polygon is drawn onto the fog canvas using the `destination-out` composite operation with a soft radial gradient. This **permanently erases** the fog wherever the sensor has swept, giving a smooth game-engine-style exploration effect.
